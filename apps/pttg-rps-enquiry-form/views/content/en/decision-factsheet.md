If you qualify for settled or pre-settled status, we will tell you how you can prove your status through an online service.

You will not get a physical document unless you’re from outside the EU and do not already have a biometric residence card.

If you don’t qualify, you will be able to appeal the decision if you apply after 29 March 2019.

You can also reapply as many times as you want to before 30 June 2021. You’ll have to pay the fee each time you apply.
