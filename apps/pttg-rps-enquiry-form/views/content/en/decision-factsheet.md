*Your application may take longer if:*

- we need more information from you
- we need to make more detailed checks on part of your application, for example if you have a criminal record

We'll tell you if we need more information from you.

**How will I hear back?**

You will receive our decision by post or by email. You won't get an official document that confirms your status. We'll tell you how you can prove your status to employers, landlords and when you travel.

This advice is based on the information you have provided. It only covers common situations. It may not apply to your specific case, particularly if your situation is complex or unusual.
