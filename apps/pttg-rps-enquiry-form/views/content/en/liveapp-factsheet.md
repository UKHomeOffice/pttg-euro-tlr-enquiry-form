# While your application is in progress
If it looks like you have made a mistake in your application, we will contact you before making a decision so you can correct any errors.

We’ll also tell you if you need to provide more evidence before we can make a decision.

If your circumstances change while your application is being considered – for example, if you change your address or phone number – you will be able to update your details.
You can withdraw your application at any time, but your fee will not be refunded.
