### How will I prove my identity?
You may be able to confirm your identity with a mobile app if you have:

If your passport or national identity card has a biometric chip it will have this picture on it: 

The app will scan your document and photograph your face.

If you don't use the app you must send your passport or national identity card to us to check. We'll tell you how to do this. We'll scan your document and send it back to you within 72 hours.

### What happens after I apply?
You can choose to receive our decision by post or by email. You won't get an official document that confirms your status. We'll tell you how you can prove your status to employers, landlords and when you travel.
